(** [Connection] manages the connection to Reddit, including authentication and
    rate limiting behavior.

    It is responsible for taking the endpoint specifications in
    {!module:Reddit_api_kernel.Api} and actually performing HTTP requests.

    {1 Authentication }

    [Connection] currently only supports the "script" app type. See 
    {{:https://github.com/reddit-archive/reddit/wiki/oauth2-app-types}
    Reddit's documentation on app types}.

    {1 Rate-limiting behavior }

    [Connection] enforces two different forms of rate-limiting:

    {2 HTTP rate-limiting headers }

    Reddit tracks API usage and requires that a client make no more than 600
    requests in a 10 minute period.

    Rather than simply keeping a counter of requests internally, [Connection]
    reads Reddit's API response headers to learn about the request quota,
    including the number of remaining requests and the time until the quota
    resets. This allows multiple [Connection.t]s with the same credentials to
    run in parallel, accounting for each others' quota usage without explicit
    coordination.

    {2 Minimum time between requests }

    In order to abide by /u/kemitche's 
    {{:https://www.reddit.com/r/redditdev/comments/1yxrp7/formal_ratelimiting_headers/} 
    request} to "be reasonable" and not slam all 600 requests in as quickly as
    possible, [Connection] also enforces a 100ms delay between requests.
